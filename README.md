# my-minions

A collection of ansible playbooks used to launch multiple EC2 instances, run the same benchmark across different CPU architectures, then collect results back locally. It's primarily designed to work with [ckb-vm-sysbench](https://github.com/xxuejie/ckb-vm-sysbench) but there might also be other use cases.

# Credits

A lot of the AWS-related code is borrowed from [ansible-real-life](https://github.com/ginigangadharan/ansible-real-life/tree/main/Ansible-AWS-Provisioning).
